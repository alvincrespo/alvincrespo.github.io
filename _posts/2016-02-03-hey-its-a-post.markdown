Over the years I've had multiple blogs and wrote about many topics.
But I find it more difficult every time to keep it up to date, and
making sure that the content being written is relevant and correct. Now
I'm striving to do the same thing with this more stripped down version.

Previously I found it difficult to keep up with my blogs, mostly because
technology would get in the way - in almost every aspect. From keeping
the dependencies up to date, to ensuring that I was using the correct
stack that would show off my skills. What I've come to realize is that
the technology behind the stack is not as important as what is being
communicated.

Thus this new adventure begins and a new blog is rolled out! Hopefully
this keeps you interested and at the end of the day...helps.
